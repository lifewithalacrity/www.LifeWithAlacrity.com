I regularly post all of my "Musings of a Trust Architect" to both here and [Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/), but other posts at Blockchain Commons may be of interest as well. Here's a look at other topics at Blockchain Commons this year.

## Quarterly Reports

What is Blockchain Commons exactly? And what's going on there? Those are discussed in the quarterly (and yearly) reports.

* [Blockchain Commons: Q3, 2024](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q3-2024/)
* [Blockchain Commons: Q2, 2024](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q2-2024/)
* [Blockchain Commons: Q1, 2024](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q1-2024/)
* [Blockchain Commons: 2023 in Review](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Yearly-2023/)

## Echoes from History

I've posted my Echoes from Histories articles here, on [the tragedy of identity during WWII](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/echoes-history/) and [the dangers of EIDAS](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/eidas/).

I also gave a talk on the topic of identity and its dangers on Foremembrance Day.

## FROST

FROST, a Schnorr-based threshold signature system, may be one of the top innovations for digital assets this year. I've hosted a few different meetings to share information on the new technology over the last year.

## Gordian Envelope

One of my major focuses at Blockchain Commons is improving privacy through the elision capabilities of Gordian Envelope, which allows the storage of data and then the redaction of part of that data before it's transmitted, all while maintaining signatures and therefore verifiability. This year I've worked with my lead researcher, Wolf McNally, to produce a series of videos detailing Gordian Envelope's capabilities.
