I found some old Xanadu docs on this &amp; scanned them for posterity: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/qeyywxr9vk45dwx/Xanadu%20Club%20System%20%28from%20Xanadu%20Spire%201.0%2004-1991%29.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qeyywxr9vk45dwx/Xanadu%20Club%20System%20%28from%20Xanadu%20Spire%201.0%2004-1991%29.pdf?dl=0)

> In modern day cryptographic terms, each Xanadu document is like an encrypted git commit (a point in time of a collaborative document). The Read Club has the decryption key to read the data. The Write Club can collaborate to sign future revisions of document.

> As I think about how the Club System might be implemented today, the Read Club would be architected something like Minilock, [https://45678.github.io/miniLock-file-format/2.html](https://45678.github.io/miniLock-file-format/2.html) with its list of public key "permits" that can be unlocked using a Diffie-Hellman secret between keys to reveal the decryption key.

> The Write Club would be something like a Threshold Schnorr Musig, where in a MPC ceremony the participants of the old document could sign new commit to show that the revision was properly derived from a threshold of its original authors.
