> We are making good progress on a new standard that allows for airgapped PSBT signing between networked wallets, using animated QR with xpubs and non-networked devices with private keys. Key research item was limits on e-paper displays like #LetheKit uses. Great results @gorazdko!

> Absolutely! The designer of #LetheKit @ksedgwic has been working on dedicated airgapped hardware for lighting as well. A key question in some of those use cases is actually the camera ‚Äî¬†you may need a better display to use cheaper cameras because of auto-focus problems.
