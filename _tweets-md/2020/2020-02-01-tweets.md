> #RWOT10, scheduled for Buenos Aires on March 16-20 has been cancelled. We deeply regret this necessity, but our  local hosts let us know that the Argentinian government is now advising against meetings of 10 or more people if they involve foreign travelers. 1/6

> This is a worldwide response to COVID-19.  Conferences  such as  F8, Geneva Motor Show, and MWC Barcelona have already been cancelled. Whether we consider the concerns valid or overblown, the international environment had made gatherings of this sort impossible at this time. 2/6
