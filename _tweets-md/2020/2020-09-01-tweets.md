> Unfortunately, the Trezor team decided to not convert the binary master seed into keys the way that BIP-39 does. Thus the same master seed on your Trezor will generate completely different accounts if you use SLIP-39. They have a rationale, but we don’t accept breaking BIP-39.

> If you are using single-keys don’t use BIP-38 passwords. You’ve just moved to challenge of securing and making your digital assets more resilient to another spot, rather than addressing the points of failure at their root. Definitely don’t use with multisig.
