> In the year since the release of our #SmartCustody digital-asset checklists, resources, and risk modeling there have been many changes to our ecosystem. For example, last year's edition could only safely recommend single-signature cold storage approaches for self-custody. (4/14)

> In the 1st edition of #SmartCustody we detail best practices &amp; default storage scenarios, offer an exercise for you to learn how to model digital asset flows, create a risk model, do an adversarial analysis, and use these tools to modify your personal storage scenario. (2/14)

> Classic risk-modeling indentifies vulnerabilities and turns those vulnerabilities into risks based on likelihoods and consequences. You'll still find all of that in #SmartCustody. It's only after we've identified these initial risks that we bring in our adversaries. (9/14)

> Classic risk-modeling techniques can be overwhelming, so the #SmartCustody book offers a different approach that helps users to protect their digital assets by figuring out what endangers them. I do this using a unique method: exposing ADVERSARIES. (8/14)

> We can look at the motives of Death or Institutional Theft or Blackmail. We can consider what they want, even in situations when they're not thinking beings. By better considering motives, we can better understand if an adversary is actually a threat to *US*. (12/14)

> Why adversaries? Because they flip the script. We go from discussing somewhat vague and abstract vulnerabilities to considering something more concrete. In the abstract, we might fall prey to our own biases; when things are made concrete, we hew closer to reality. (11/14)

> So what's an adversary? It's an anthropomorphized problem. Each one can encompass many different risks and have many different solutions. Losing your funds due to incapacitation is a potential risk, but DEATH, that's an adversary. (10/14)
