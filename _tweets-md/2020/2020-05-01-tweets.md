> I have been designing the architectural underpinnings of BTCR and the Amira use case in my design of @FullyNoded 2 iOS bitcoin multisig wallet\. But it is underfunded so slow going\. Also challenging is BTCR roots were designed 5 years ago pre\-segwit, so aspects needs rethink\.

> I was talking to @MarkFriedenbach and it could be that some pre\-commit phase before creating account map \(aka wallet descriptor\) could be useful\. We’ll need one for Schnorr at some point anyhow so we’ll need UX for that someday\.

> This is one of my concerns with some of the newer DID methods\. The whole point originally of DIDs was you could use many of them, revoke them cheaply &amp; rotate each to new keys regularly\.
