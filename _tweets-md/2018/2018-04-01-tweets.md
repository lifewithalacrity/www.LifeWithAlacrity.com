> 1/ On this day two years ago I chose the term “Self-Sovereign Identity” as the name for a new manifesto of 10 foundational principles for digital identity. It was a rallying cry to start a movement toward human-rights focused decentralized identity. [https://twitter.com/christophera/status/724754197762068480](https://twitter.com/christophera/status/724754197762068480)

----



> 2/ I was not the first to use the term. The earliest I know of was Devon Loffreto @NZN writing in Project VRM and later in his blog about "sovereign source authority" where he said that individuals “have an established Right to an ‘identity’”. [https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html](https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html)

----



> 8/ Self-Sovereign Identity begins with the basic premise that you should control your own identity in interactions with organizations &amp; other people. [https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md)

----



> 9/ Self-Sovereignty doesn’t mean that you are in complete control. But it does define the borders within which you can make decisions and outside of which you negotiate with others as peers, not as a petitioner.

----



> 10/ Today, digital identity is administered by centralized authorities such as governments, corporations &amp; software platform providers. They have a vested interest in constraining people both on &amp; offline because they desire to either control behavior or to make a profit from it.

> 11/ Self-Sovereign Identity is rooted in principles from the Enlightenment, as well as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/media/tweet.ico" width="30" /> [Wed Apr 25 12:37:30 +0000 2018](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/989121219105521665)

----



> 12/ The first principle of Self-Sovereign identity is that as human beings we exist. Our personal existence is our most fundamental fact, and the control over our self is our most fundamental freedom, our “Unalienable Right". This should also be true in the digital world.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/media/tweet.ico" width="30" /> [Wed Apr 25 12:37:44 +0000 2018](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/989121278916390912)

----



> 13/ As digital systems create representations of us, a free society demands that we be given a voice in deciding how those representations are created and used. Not because we own that data, but because individual human beings are the ONLY valid source for that moral authority.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/media/tweet.ico" width="30" /> [Wed Apr 25 12:37:56 +0000 2018](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/989121331156410368)

----



> 14/ Human dignity demands that individuals be treated with respect no matter which system they interact with, face-to-face or online. Without that, we become nothing but data in the machine—entries in a ledger to be managed, problems to be solved, digital serfs. We are not.

> 15/ A real test of this concept &amp; manifesto was the first United Nations Summit on Digital Identity, #ID2020. Some feared that diplomats would disapprove of the concept. Yet in the first hours I heard two UN officials &amp; ambassadors use the term. [https://id2020.org/news/2016/12/2/identity-20](https://id2020.org/news/2016/12/2/identity-20)

----



> 16/ Later I heard the concept resonated, as many UN staffers are frustrated with sovereign-nations, due to the 1.563 million stateless people with no citizenship at all, both clashing with the rights offered to all by the Declaration of Human Rights.

> 17/ In Europe, the emergence of new EU law around personal privacy, known as GDPR, has helped with adoption of the concept, as many feel the current centralized identity architectures will not be able to handle the new regulation: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gdpr-reflection-self-sovereign-identity-blockchain-nicolas-ameye/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gdpr-reflection-self-sovereign-identity-blockchain-nicolas-ameye/)
