> I do like the did:doge trick. Could be good for 0.2. But with Taproot/Schnorr possible soon now if Simple Trial passes MASF, then there are some good choices for a BTCR 1.0 that have the anti-correlation, censorship-resistance &amp;  confidentiality that I wanted that 0.1 never had.

> Absolutely! Not just MAST &amp; Schnorr, but we can also leverage P2P cooperative techniques like coinjoin &amp; L2 (Lighting &amp; RGB style) to share and/or lower costs. Likely we’ll still be more more expensive than did:ion but much more private.
