> The drawbacks of cryptographic agility include high implementation and support costs, bad interactions, and downgrade attacks. Each new cryptographic option explodes the cost of implementation, the attack surface, and ultimately the chance of some sort of problem. [3/11]

> Many people still believe that cryptographic agility is still the preferred way to design software, and that it is the best solution for possible futures when an algorithm needs to be deprecated, such as when quantum computing arrives. But instead, it causes more problems! [2/11]

> Alternatives to crypto agility include limited cipher suites, specific methods for use in different ecosystems, and clean and well-separated layers. These allow for thorough testing &amp; code review and reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities arising from interactions. [6/11]

> Other approaches, such an "opinionated" crypto suite such as Wireguard offers, or restricting use to a single suite but having a 2nd one prepared and set aside for the future, can also be improvements over legacy cryptographic agility. [8/11]
