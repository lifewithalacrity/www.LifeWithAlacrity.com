> Latest white paper from September's #RWOT12. Goal is to understand &amp; tie together various decentralized #web3 identity efforts with W3C Verifiable Credentials. For instance, how various on-chain proofs are used to help in the verification of claims. Team led by @by_caballero.

> Yes, you can do a Bitcoin full-node without tx data, or even do a pruned full-node, but we have to think long-term (decades). That being said, changing the limit of op_return from 80 to 128 or 256 bytes allows for a lot of functionality without as much risk.
