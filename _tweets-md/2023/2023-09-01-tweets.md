> I’ve been talking about self-sovereignty since I introduced self-sovereign identity back in 2016. That was about controlling your digital identity, this is about controlling your digital existence. [2/8] [http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html)

> You deserve to be the captain of your own vessel on the digital seas. That’s the simple premise of my new article on Self-Sovereign Computing. [1/8] [https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/)

> Self-sovereign identity was a great first step, but we need to be the owners of our whole experience online, especially as it becomes more important to our everyday life. [6/8]

> But you still have responsibilities. In my paradigm of self-sovereign computing, we need to support other community members, either through collective bargaining or sharing resources. It’s the only way we can actually become peers with the corporate behemoths. [5/8]

> The crucial difference is that you’re not a serf to corporate entities, or in this metaphor a passenger on a vessel. Instead you’re captain working and negotiating at parity with others. [4/8]

> But I hope it also clarifies a crucial fact that I think has gotten muddled over the last several: self-sovereignty isn’t about going it alone. It’s about becoming a peer in a community. [3/8]

> The Principle of Least Privilege (or Least Authority) is a cornerstone principle for computer security. But how does it apply to data? That’s what my newest Musings of Trust Architect discusses. 🧵[1/9]. [https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Least-Necessary/](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Least-Necessary/)
