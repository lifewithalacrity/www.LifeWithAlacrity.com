> I‚Äôve been talking about self-sovereignty since I introduced self-sovereign identity back in 2016. That was about controlling your digital identity, this is about controlling your digital existence.

> You deserve to be the captain of your own vessel on the digital seas. That‚Äôs the simple premise of my new article on Self-Sovereign Computing. [1/8] [https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/)

> Self-sovereign identity was a great first step, but we need to be the owners of our whole experience online, especially as it becomes more important to our everyday life. [6/8]

> But you still have responsibilities. In my paradigm of self-sovereign computing, we need to support other community members, either through collective bargaining or sharing resources. It‚Äôs the only way we can actually become peers with the corporate behemoths. [5/8]

> The crucial difference is that you‚Äôre not a serf to corporate entities, or in this metaphor a passenger on a vessel. Instead you‚Äôre captain working and negotiating at parity with others. [4/8]

> But I hope it also clarifies a crucial fact that I think has gotten muddled over the last several: self-sovereignty isn‚Äôt about going it alone. It‚Äôs about becoming a peer in a community. [3/8]
