> BBS+ proofs are a powerful anti-correlation tool, but are inherently complex to implement. First, it uses pairing crypto, which is not inherently bad but is comparatively new (and quite different) than elliptic curves. Then it is also zk-proof, which also complicated.

> The combo of pairing based zk-proof allows for a proof of knowledge of an undisclosed signature, which supports anti-correlation of signatures &amp; public keys. But this is not intuitive to implement. Hash-based elision (aka redaction) is much easier, but does have limitations.

> My proposal is that all signed data at rest needs to support minimal disclosure and some measure of anti-correlation, and hash-based elision meets the 80/20 test. If you need more, then add BBS+ or other methods once you understand the use case and threats.

> I would love more people to support Gordian Envelope’s architecture for this, but I do ask that we begin to demand hash-based elision in the future for signed data at rest whether it be ISO mDOC, IETF SD-JWT, or LD Merkle Disclosure Proof. A MUST not MAY or SHOULD.

> You don’t need anything but a hash algo like sha256 to do hash-based elision. Salting can address most anti-correlation requirements (but not for signatures). But often you need correlation for signatures, as that is their whole point. [https://youtu.be/OcnpYqHn8NQ](https://youtu.be/OcnpYqHn8NQ)

> I’d need to understand the use case to say if BBS+’s ability to obfuscate a signature is required for any particular use case. But even then, trying to shoehorn it to solve all data-minimization problems when 80% don’t require it is overwhelming.

> I like the concept and we have designed the Gordian architecture to support it, but focused on fundamentals first. 80/20 rule &amp; “the perfect is the enemy of the good”. When I helped lead the design of TLS, perfect forward secrecy was hard, but in the architecture.

> In my opinion that there are certain things that Gordian Envelopes can do easy, like inclusion proofs and herd privacy, that BBS+ proofs can’t. There are also other interesting blinded signature and zk approaches to these problems emerging that work better with multisig futures.
