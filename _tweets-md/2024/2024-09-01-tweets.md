> The discovery of an elliptic curve with rank 29 isn't just a mathematical curiosity‚Äîit's a may be game-changer! Higher rank elliptic curves mean more rational points, which are crucial for cryptography, offering new possibilities for secure key generation. üîê 1/3 [https://twitter.com/dujella1/status/1829272772343898176](https://twitter.com/dujella1/status/1829272772343898176)

> There is a hypothesis that there are a finite number of high rank elliptic curves, and as last (28) was discovered in 2006 that there might not be more. But now larger ranks may be plausible. More ranks may offer greater security or boost the efficiency of algorithms. 2/3
