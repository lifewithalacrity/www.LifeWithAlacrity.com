> Today's Gordian Wallet Community meeting focused on Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol (GSTP), a secure, transport-agnostic request/response system that supports Encrypted State Continuations (ESC) [1/17].

> Why GSTP? We need safe communication via a variety of transport methods, some of them unusual. We're not just talking about TLS for wired communication. (I co-authored TLS!) We need something more for many modern use cases, including data at rest. [2/17]

> GSTP is SECURE. This means that it uses encryption and authentication to verify every message. It is bidirectional and supports P2P thanks to key agreement using ephemeral public keys, thus avoiding the problems of centralized certification. [3/17]

> GSTP is TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC. Sure, it could go out via TCP/IP, or it could use Tor. But it also might be sent via QR code, bluetooth, or NFC. Many of these are quite insecure as transit methods, which is why we need GSTP. [4/17]

> GSTP is DISTRIBUTED. It supports ESC (Encrypted State Continuations), to securely encapsulate state information. This allows computation to be resumed later without needing to retain state locally, making it ideal for constrained devices and scalable server environments. [5/17]

> How do you create, manage &amp; store digital-asset seeds in a way that's secure &amp; resilient? That's a question that @BlockchainComns has worked on since the start &amp; we'd like to talk about a useful tool at our meeting this August: BIP-85.

> BIP-85 is fundamentally a way to use a master seed to deterministically generate children seed, so you can safely use one seed to manage seeds on a multitude of devices. [4/10]
