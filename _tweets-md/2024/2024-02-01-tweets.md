> I had my #VisionPro demo today. 30m with their demo at an Apple Store. As well done as previewers say, but the main thing I wanted to test was seeing my MackBookPro display. I also chatted with @Dom of old #iPhoneDevCamp team about prospects for https://visiondevcamp.org. Sponsors? https://twitter.com/NicoleLazzaro/status/1724932006872817935

> Best video I’ve seen so far that explains the #VisionPro experience is by @MKBHD at https://youtu.be/dtp6b76pMak?si=FnhpIoajB4GDd5zH In particular see the FaceTime section near the end. I had some personal experience talking with @dom this way. Imperfect but an interesting social construction.
