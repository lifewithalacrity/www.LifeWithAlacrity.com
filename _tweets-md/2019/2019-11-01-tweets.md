> We are working on better (and easier) processes for this in the BitcoinStandup project [https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup) — currently only Mac, but working on more platforms. Also allows for secure v3 tor connection to remote client, such as iOS @FullyNoded

> #BitcoinStandup will make it easier for @FullyNoded as well as any other remote that wants a v3 tor secure non-correlatable remote connection back to a full node. A work in progress and Mac-only for now, but more platforms soon. [https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup/](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup/)

It’s about allowing others (including competitors) to incrementally improve on those practices. And listening back.
