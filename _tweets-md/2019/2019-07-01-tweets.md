> Interesting, some of these approaches toward "Reduced Binary Seed" make use of minimized Scheme, which is also a potential target for Russel O’Connor’s of @Blockstream’s provable Simplicy toolchain, which can maybe probably secure each of the Scheme atoms\. https://twitter\.com/christophera/status/1073713691160338432?s\=21

> I’m not suggesting that Russel’s Simplicity toolchain is for securing Unix bootstrap, instead focus is to secure future blockchain script languages\. However, it does seem that it too can support Scheme\-like script atoms, and lessons from it could be leveraged beyond blockchains\.

> I think their ideal is to reduce it so that someone else can audit it\. 😉 But I’m worried about the security of both the underlying unix architecture \(for instance ACLs vs ocap\) &amp; hardware assumptions \(hardware memory practices &amp; I/O drivers\) that the OS mandates or relies on\.
