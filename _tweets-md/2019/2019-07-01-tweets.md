> In my most recent design the players start with no character. First player asks another player a question, which they answer. Then the answering player asks the next player a question. Your character is defined by these leading questions. It works in play tests surprisingly well.

> Also from PBTW, Flotsam uses a list of Principles to guide the stories in the collaborative world but gets all the players to support those principles. Flotsam doesn't quite have the Moves of PBTA, but each playbook has a special move that incentivizes role specialization.

> Another GM led game system that Flotsam adapts ideas from is Fate, with its use of fate tokens. Basically, fate tokens incentivize players to allow their characters to have weakness &amp; faults come into play, and Flotsam uses tokens for similar purpose.

> Summary: I've not playtested it yet, but at first read seems a very good GMless system, in particular for telling "common people" stories of the less powerful people in a space opera universe. If you like PBTA-style games Flotsam takes player agency further in a powerful way.

> Flotsam seems like a good first GMless game for a playgroup with no GMless experience if they have played PBTA, Fate or other RPG games with player agency. It looks particularly good for ongoing play. I look forward to seeing how it is adapted for other genres!
