> When I was teaching for an MBA for Sustainable Systems program, I was part of team that designed a new first year. Instead 30 credit hours of typically 3 credit hour courses, it was a carefully designed sequence of a 9 credit hour course for three quarters, plus hour of coaching.

> This meant, say for the 2nd quarter, Operations was taught same time as Marketing, which meant that an operations case study you used last week might be the starting point for a marketing case study this week. Everything was integrated. Hard on teachers though!

> No. But there is one foundational transaction that is on chain. Like a lightning node a BTCR DID is an encoding of blockheight, transaction in block &amp; output index in that transaction. The output index must still have unspent funds associated with it. See: [https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0Bcwqiyw6RGvMZgDyFt-prI_g#BTCR](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0Bcwqiyw6RGvMZgDyFt-prI_g#BTCR)

> Information about where to find information about individual claims issued by that DID are typically stored in IPFS objects which are widely distributed—there you can discover if it is revoked. Right they are CRLs, but there are hash tree based revocation list services coming.
