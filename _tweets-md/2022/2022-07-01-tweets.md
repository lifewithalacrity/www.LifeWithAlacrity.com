> CSR is one way to ensure the resilience of your crypto-seed (or other vital digital data), but not the only one. We also are working on multisig scenarios and distributed key generation tech. But CSR allows us to offer resilience for your digital assets and identity today [5/8].

> CSR is not just for social key recovery. It is part of a new architecture from @BlockchainComns that empowers a web of share servers, any one of which can be used to hold your sharded secrets. That means you can use it for self-sovereign custody of keys. [4/8]
